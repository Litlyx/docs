## Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, ensure you:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Have installed Next">
    Get started [here](https://nextjs.org/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your project ID">
    Sign up on [Litlyx Dashboard](https://dashboard.litlyx.com/) and create a new project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 1. Install

Choose your package manager & install the library.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install litlyx-js
```
```bash yarn
yarn add litlyx-js
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add litlyx-js
```
```bash bun
bun install litlyx-js
```
</CodeGroup>


## 2. Import
Now import litlyx in your `entry-point` file. Normally in Next, you can add this in `layout.tsx`.

```javascript javascript
import { Lit } from "litlyx-js"
```

<Note>Don't forget to add `use client` over the imports</Note>


## 3. Initialize

Next, initialize Litlyx library with your project in your entry-point file as follow:

```javascript javascript
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  Lit.init("your_project_id");
  return (
    <html lang="en" className="dark">
      <body
        className="antialiased overflow-x-hidden"
      >
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

This line will already collect more than 10 KPIs for you such as `Page Visits`, `Referrers`, `Countries`, `Unique Sessions` and many more.


## 4. Collect Custom Events
To customize your experience, add the following line in each function you desire. There is no limit to the number of events.

```javascript javascript
Lit.event("your_event_name");
```

If you want to exercise more control over your events, you can use the `metadata` field.

```javascript javascript
Lit.event("your_event_name", metadata: { 
  'type': 'MAIN_CTA', 
  'priority': 0.9
});
```

In your dashboard, you can group them in the `Events` tab with the `Event Metadata Analyzer`.

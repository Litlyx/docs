## Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, ensure you:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Knows the basics for Typescript.">
    Get started [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="have a project on Supabase, Firebase ecc...">
    That can trigger your functions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 1. Install

Choose your package manager & install the library.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install litlyx-js
```
```bash yarn
yarn add litlyx-js
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add litlyx-js
```
```bash bun
bun install litlyx-js
```
</CodeGroup>


## 2. Import
Now import litlyx in your `entry-point` file. Normally in Nuxt, it is called `main.vue`.

```javascript javascript
import {Lit} from litlyx.js
```

## 3. Initialize

Next, connect the Litlyx library with your project in your entry-point file, `main.vue`, as follows:

```javascript javascript
Lit.init("your_project_id");
```

This line will already collect more than 10 KPIs for you such as `Page Visits`, `Referrers`, `Countries`, `Unique Sessions` and many more.


## 4. Collect Custom Events
To customize your experience, add the following line in each function you desire. There is no limit to the number of events.

```javascript javascript
Lit.event("your_event_name");
```
If you want to exercise more control over your events, you can use the `metadata` field. In your dashboard, you can group them in the `Events` tab with the `Event Metadata Analyzer`.

```javascript javascript
Lit.event("your_event_name", metadata: { 
  'type': 'MAIN_CTA', 
  'priority': 0.9
});
```

## 5. Your turn now!

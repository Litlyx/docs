description: 'Learn how to track your first visit and event using Cloud Functions, Lambda Functions, or Edge Functions.'

## Pre-Requisites
Choose your preferred method to serve serverless functions.

## Firebase

Before proceeding, make sure you've installed `litlyx-js` using your favorite package manager in your Firebase environment.

```javascript javascript
const { onCall } = require("firebase-functions/v2/https");

const { Lit } = require('litlyx-js');

exports.logEvent = onCall((request) => {

  Lit.init('PID')

  const { eventName } = request.data;

  Lit.event(eventName);
});
```

## Coming soon

In the near future, we will be adding support for more serverless environments such as Deno, Vercel Functions, Supabase Edge Functions.

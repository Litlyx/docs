## Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, ensure you:
<Steps>
<Step title="Configure a Google Tag Manager Account">
    Get started [here](https://tagmanager.google.com).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your litlyx's workspace ID">
    Sign up on [Litlyx Dashboard](https://dashboard.litlyx.com/) and create a new workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 1. Create a new Tag

In your Google Tag Manager account, add a new tag.

Edit the tag configuration and choose `Custom HTML` for the tag type.

## 2. Initialize

Next, paste your Litlyx javaScript tracking snippet in the `HTML` field within the `Custom HTML` section as follow: 

```javascript javascript
<script>
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.defer = true;
script.dataset.workspace = "workspace_id";
script.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/litlyx-js@latest/browser/litlyx.js";
document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);
</script>
```

## 3. Setup a trigger
After pasting the snippet, add a trigger to make this tag fire. Select the "All Pages" and filter "Page View" as the trigger if you want to count all your pages.

## 4. Publish your Tag

Give your tag a name... we suggest `Litlyx Analytics`.

Than, click on the `Save` button. Click `Submit` to submit your changes. Then click on the `Publish` button

## 5. Your turn now!

That's it! Now you can go to your website and verify Litlyx Analytics script has been added and go to your dashboard to see whether the data are being tracked.

## Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, ensure you sign up on [Litlyx](https://dashboard.litlyx.com/) and create a new workspace.

## 1. Install
With this line of code in your **index.html**, inside the **body** or **head** tag, you can already collect analytics like `Page Visits`, `Referrers`, `Avarage Session Time` and many more.

```javascript javascript
<script defer data-workspace="workspace_id" 
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js">
</script>
```

## 2. Collect Custom Events
To customize your experience, add the following line in each function you desire. There is no limit to the number of events.

```javascript javascript
Lit.event("your_event_name");
```
If you want to exercise more control over your events, you can use the `metadata` field. In your dashboard, you can group them in the `Events` tab with the `Event Metadata Analyzer`.

```javascript javascript
Lit.event("your_event_name", metadata: { 
  'type': 'MAIN_CTA', 
  'priority': 0.9
});
```

## HTML example code

```html 
<button onclick="Lit.event('click-on-buy')">Buy</button>
```


## 3. Your turn now!

Use litlyx in your html website at ease.

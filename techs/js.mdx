## Pre-Requisites

None. Let's go ahead


## 1. Install
It's just this simple. With this line of code in your `index.html`, under the `body` tag, you can already record analytics like `page visits`, `referrers`, `avarage session time` and many more.

```html 
<script defer data-project="project_id_here" 
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js">
</script>
```

To get your `project_id`, [Create your project on Litlyx Cloud.](https://dashboard.litlyx.com)



## 4. Collect Custom Events
To customize your experience, add the following line in each function you desire. There is no limit to the number of events.

```javascript javascript
Lit.event("your_event_name");
```
If you want to exercise more control over your events, you can use the `metadata` field. In your dashboard, you can group them in the `Events` tab with the `Event Metadata Analyzer`.

```javascript javascript
Lit.event("your_event_name", metadata: { 
  'type': 'MAIN_CTA', 
  'priority': 0.9
});
```

## Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, ensure you sign up on [Litlyx](https://dashboard.litlyx.com/) and create a new project.

## How to Connect Litlyx Analytics to Your Shopify Store

Track what your visitors do, where they come from, and key e-commerce actions... all in one place.
It's divided in two parts:

### 1. Standard Setup (Required)

This step installs the Litlyx script to track visits on all your pages... like the homepage, product pages, and collection pages.

**Setup time:** 1 minute

### 2. Advanced Event Tracking (Optional)

Uses Shopify Web Pixels to automatically send e-commerce events to Litlyx.

**Setup time:**  3 minutes

With this, you can track actions like:
- **Adding a product to the cart**
- **Starting checkout**
- **Completing a purchase**
- **Viewing checkout pages**

<Note>
These actions are not tracked by the standard setup alone. For full e-commerce tracking, we recommend enabling this step.
</Note>

## Step 1: Standard Setup (mandatory)

This mode turns on Litlyx for all the public pages of your site.

Steps
1. Access the Shopify panel.
2. Go on `Sales Channels` > `Online Store` > `Themes`.
3. Find the `active theme`, click on the 3 dots button `(‚ãÆ)` and select **Edit code**.
4. Open the file: `layout/theme.liquid`.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/shopify.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>

### Insert script into the head section.

1. In the `theme.liquid` file, look for the `<head>` tag.
2. Paste the following code just right before `</head>`:

```javascript 
<script defer data-project="project_id_here" 
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js">
</script>
```

3. Change `project_id_here` with your project_id from Litlyx‚Äôs dashboard.
4. Click on **Save** on the top-right corner.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/shopify-2.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>

**That‚Äôs it!** Litlyx is now up and running.

It‚Äôs already tracking key metrics like `visitor counts`, `real-time users`, `top pages`, `traffic sources`, `bounce rate`, and more.

<Note>
Now you‚Äôre ready to set up the second part‚Ä¶ this will let you send custom events to Litlyx for deeper insights.
</Note>

## Track custom events with Web Pixels API (optional)

Send advanced e-commerce events from Shopify directly to Litlyx's Custom Events page.

- **page_viewed**
- **product_viewed**
- **product_added_to_cart**
- **product_removed_from_cart**
- **checkout_started**
- **checkout_completed**

3. Give your Pixel a name, e.g. **Litlyx Web Pixel**.
4. Click on `Add Pixel` to save.

5. Look for the `code` field.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/shopify-5.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>

6. Enter the following code:

```javascript 
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.defer = true; 
// Important step
script.dataset.manual = true;
// Change with you project_id
script.dataset.project = "project_id";
script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);
script.onload = () => {
    //See the examples below to add 
    //the scripts you need in this section.
};
```

7. Click on `Connect`.

  src="/images/shopify-6.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>

Your new Pixel is all set to track the events you want to send to Litlyx‚Äôs dashboard.
Let‚Äôs take a look at some events we think you‚Äôll enjoy keeping an eye on.

## Track e-commerce events in Litlyx using Custom Events

Here is a summary of the events supported by Shopify and trackable with `analytics.subscribe()` function.

## Most common E-commerce events you may want to track
<Note>
üí° You can also use analytics.subscribe("all_standard_events", ...) to debug and try all available events.
</Note>

### product_viewed

```javascript 
analytics.subscribe("product_viewed", (event) => {
  const variantTitle = event.data.productVariant.title ?? "";
  const productTitle = event.data.productVariant.product.title;
  const productId = event.data.productVariant.product.id;
  const price = event.data.productVariant.price.amount;
  const currency = event.data.productVariant.price.currencyCode;

  Lit.event("Product viewed", {
    product_id: productId,
    title: `${productTitle} ${variantTitle}`,
    price,
    currency
  });
});
```
### product_added_to_cart

```javascript 
analytics.subscribe('product_added_to_cart', (event) => {
  const line = event.data.cartLine;
  const title = `${line.merchandise.product.title} ${line.merchandise.title}`;
  const price = line.cost.totalAmount.amount;
  const currency = line.cost.totalAmount.currencyCode;

  Lit.event('Add to cart', {
    metadata: {
      "product-name": title,
      "price": price,
      "currency": currency
    }
  });
});
```

### checkout_started

```javascript 
analytics.subscribe('checkout_started', (event) => {
  const amount = event.data.checkout.totalPrice.amount;
  const currency = event.data.checkout.currencyCode;

  Lit.event('Checkout started', {
    metadata: {
      amount,
      currency
    }
  });
});
```

### checkout_completed

```javascript 
analytics.subscribe('checkout_completed', (event) => {
  const checkout = event.data.checkout;
  const totalPrice = checkout.totalPrice?.amount;
  const discounts = checkout.discountApplications.map(d => d.title);
  const firstItem = checkout.lineItems[0];
  const firstItemDiscount = firstItem.discountAllocations[0]?.amount;

  const transactions = checkout.transactions.map(tx => ({
    paymentGateway: tx.gateway,
    amount: tx.amount
  }));

  Lit.event('Checkout Completed', {
    metadata: {
      totalPrice,
      discountCodesUsed: discounts,
      firstItem: {
        quantity: firstItem.quantity,
        title: firstItem.title,
        discount: firstItemDiscount
      },
      paymentTransactions: transactions
    }
  });
});
```

## Send checkout page views from Shopify to your Litlyx dashboard

The standard script doesn‚Äôt track checkout pages, because Shopify handles them differently from normal pages.

To track these pages, you need to use a `Web Pixel` and listen for the `page_viewed` event...
then check the page‚Äôs path (also called pathname).

Here are some common checkout paths you might want to track:


| page type                   | URL                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Start checkout`       | /checkouts/cn/...                                   |
| `Shipping`| /checkouts/cn/.../shipping                         |
| `Payment` | /checkouts/cn/.../payment              |
| `Review`          | /checkouts/cn/.../review                                    |
| `Thank-you (Order complete)`     | /checkouts/cn/.../thank-you                         |

### Code to track page_viewed in checkout


```javascript 
analytics.subscribe('page_viewed', async (event) => {
    const location = event.context.document.location;
    if (location.pathname.startsWith('/checkouts')) {
           Lit.pushVisit(location.pathname)
    }
  });

```
<Note>
This event is only used to track checkout pages. For all other pages, the ‚ÄúPage Viewed‚Äù event is handled by the code added in the `theme.liquid` file (see Step 1).

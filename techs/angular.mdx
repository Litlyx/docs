## Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, ensure you:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Have installed Angular">
    Get started [here](https://angular.dev/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your project ID">
    Sign up on [Litlyx Dashboard](https://dashboard.litlyx.com/) and create a new project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 1. Install

Choose your package manager & install the library.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install litlyx-js
```
```bash yarn
yarn add litlyx-js
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add litlyx-js
```
```bash bun
bun install litlyx-js
```
</CodeGroup>


## 2. Import

Now import Litlyx in your `entry-point` file. The easiest way in Angular is in the file `app.component.ts`.

```javascript javascript
import { Lit } from "litlyx-js"
```

<Note>If you have an advanced Angular project or you are a senior developer, import it in the chosen path where you configure the entire application, for example, a provider used to initialize the application in `app.module.ts`.</Note>

## 3. Initialize

Next, initialize the Litlyx library with your project in your entry-point file (always `app.component.ts` in this example) as follow:

```javascript javascript
constructor() {
    Lit.init("your_project_id");
}
```

This line will already collect more than 10 KPIs for you such as `Page Visits`, `Referrers`, `Countries`, `Unique Sessions` and many more.

<Note>If you have an advanced Angular project or you are a senior developer, remember not to show hardcoded IDs. Use a more secure pattern, for example, using an .env file and reading from it "your_project_id".</Note>

## 4. Collect Custom Events

To customize your experience, add the following line in each function you desire. There is no limit to the number of events.

If you want to test if it works and everything is well configured, import the OnInit method in the entry-point file (always `app.component.ts` in this example):

```javascript javascript
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
```

and implement the imported function as follows:

```javascript javascript
  ngOnInit(): void {
    Lit.event("your_event_name");
  }
```

If you want to exercise more control over your events, you can use the `metadata` field.

```javascript javascript
  ngOnInit(): void {
    Lit.event("your_event_name", metadata: { 
    'type': 'INIT_LIBRARY', 
    'priority': 0.9
    });
  }
```

In your dashboard, you can group them in the `Events` tab with the `Event Metadata Analyzer`.

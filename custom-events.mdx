## Minimal Setup for Tailor-made Analytics

Add the following line of code, in each key `function` you would like to track.


```javascript 
Lit.event("click-on-buy");
```

To get your `project_id`, [Create your project on Litlyx Cloud.](https://dashboard.litlyx.com)

## More control

Sometimes just an `event name` isn't enough. If you want to add more control to your data, you can use the `metadata` field. Like this:

```javascript 
Lit.event("click-on-buy", metadata: {
    "product_id": "1",
    "customer_id": "customer_id_1",
    "price": 1999.99,
    "product_name": "Design Chair with a cute cat!"
});
```


## Ready to go!

Analyze all yours `custom events` in the `Events` tab, with semplicity interacting with the charts or using our `Events Metadata Analyzer`.

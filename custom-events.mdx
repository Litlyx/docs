## Fire Your First Event with cURL

Want to quickly see how Litlyx works with events? Use the cURL command below to send a test event. Just replace the `project_id` with your actual project ID in your terminal.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://broker.litlyx.com/event" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pid": "project_id",
    "name": "testEvent1",
    "metadata": "{\"test\": \"something\"}",
    "website": "something",
    "userAgent": "something"
  }'
```

To get your `project_id`, [Create your project on Litlyx Cloud.](https://dashboard.litlyx.com)


## Minimal Setup

Ensure you alreaady initialized the library in your entry point.

Next, add the following line of code, in each key `function` you would like to track.


```javascript 
Lit.event("click-on-buy");
```

## Metadata

Sometimes just an `event name` isn't enough. If you want to add more control to your data, you can use the `metadata` field. Like this:

```javascript 
Lit.event("click-on-buy", metadata: {
    "product_id": "1",
    "customer_id": "customer_id_1",
    "price": 1999.99,
    "product_name": "Design Chair with a cute cat!"
});
```


## Ready to go!

Analyze all yours `custom events` in the `Events` tab on the cloud dashboard. Interact with the charts or analyze your metadata with our `Events Metadata Analyzer`.

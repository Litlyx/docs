## Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, ensure you:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your project ID">
    Sign up on [Litlyx](https://dashboard.litlyx.com/) and create a new project.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Fire Your First Event with cURL

Curious to see how Litlyx works with events? Simply use the cURL command below to send a test event. Just replace `project_id` with your actual project ID in your terminal.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://broker.litlyx.com/event" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pid": "project_id",
    "name": "testEvent1",
    "metadata": "{\"test\": \"something\"}",
    "website": "something",
    "userAgent": "something"
  }'
```


## Minimal Setup


<Note>
Ensure you already initialized the library in your entry point.
</Note>


Add the following line of code, in each key `function` you would like to track.


```javascript 
Lit.event("click-on-buy");
```

## Handle Metadata

Sometimes just an `event name` isn't enough. If you want to add more control to your data, you can use the `metadata` field. Like this:

```javascript 
Lit.event("click-on-buy", metadata: {
    "product_id": "1",
    "customer_id": "customer_id_1",
    "price": 1999.99,
    "product_name": "Design Chair with a cute cat!"
});
```

## HTML example code

```html 
<button onclick="Lit.event('click-on-buy')">Buy</button>
```


## Function example code

```javascript 
myFunction () {
  // your existing code...
  Lit.event('my-function-name');
}
```


## Ready to go!

Analyze all yours `custom events` on the cloud dashboard. 

- Understand how users interact with your custom events by creating `Custom Funnels`. 
- Analyze where your users come from and trigger an event with the `User Flow`.
- Interact with events metadata with our `Events Metadata Analyzer`.

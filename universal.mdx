## Pre-Requisites

Sign up on [Litlyx](https://dashboard.litlyx.com/) and create a new workspace.

## Universal Setup

With just one line of code in your **index.html** — placed either at the end of the **body** or inside the **head** tag — you can start tracking data like `Best Performing Pages`, `Unique Visitors`, `Real-time Users`, `Sources`, `Bounce Rate`, `Countries`, and much more.

```javascript 
<script defer data-workspace="workspace_id" 
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js">
</script>
```

## Website Builder Setup

Litlyx is super versatile. Use it in your favorite website builder like `Wordpress`, `Webflow`, `Framer`, or any platform that lets you add **custom code** inside the **body** or **head** tag.

```javascript 
<script defer data-workspace="workspace_id" 
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js">
</script>
```

## Using a Package Manager or Framework

Install the Litlyx library with your favorite package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install litlyx-js
```
```bash yarn
yarn add litlyx-js
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add litlyx-js
```
```bash bun
bun install litlyx-js
```
</CodeGroup>

Now import Litlyx in your `entry-point` file.

```javascript javascript
import { Lit } from "litlyx-js"
```

Next, initialize the Litlyx library with your `workspace_id` in your entry-point file as follows:

```javascript javascript
Lit.init("workspace_id");
```

## Ready to go!

  </Step>
</Steps>

## 1.a - Universal Setup (in just 30 seconds)

With a simple line of code in your **index.html**, under the **body** tag, you can start tracking analytics such as `Page Visits`, `Real-Time Users`, `Referrers`, `Bounce Rate`, `Countries`, `Unique Visitor Sessions`, `OS` & `Devices`.


```html 
<script defer data-project="project_id_here" 
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js">
</script>
```

## 1.b - Using any package manager

Install Litlyx library from your favourite package manager.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install litlyx-js
```
```bash yarn
yarn add litlyx-js
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add litlyx-js
```
```bash bun
bun install litlyx-js
```
</CodeGroup>

Now import litlyx in your `entry-point` file.

```javascript javascript
import { Lit } from "litlyx-js"
```


Next, initialize Litlyx library with your project in your entry-point file as follow:

```javascript javascript
Lit.init("your_project_id");
```

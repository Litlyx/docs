## Universal Setup \< 30 seconds!

With the following line of code in your `index.html`, under the `body` tag, you can already record analytics such as `Page Visits`, `Referrers`, `Countries`, `Unique Sessions` and many more.


```html 
<script defer data-project="project_id_here" 
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js">
</script>
```

Get your `project_id`, by visiting [Litlyx Cloud](https://dashboard.litlyx.com).


## Using any package manager like npm

Firstly, get your `project_id`, by visiting [Litlyx Cloud](https://dashboard.litlyx.com).

Install Litlyx library from your favourite package manager.

```bash npm
npm install litlyx-js
```

Now import litlyx in your `entry-point` file.

```javascript javascript
import { Lit } from "litlyx-js"
```


Next, initialize Litlyx library with your project in your entry-point file as follow:

```javascript javascript
Lit.init("your_project_id");
```

This line will already collect more than 10 KPIs for you such as `Page Visits`, `Referrers`, `Countries`, `Unique Sessions` and many more.

## 1. Fork the project

From github fork the project on your local machine.


## 2. Build A Docker Image

Open the project in your favorite IDE. Run the following command in the `terminal`.

```bash docker
docker-compose build
```

## 3. Run A Docker Container

Run the following command in the `terminal`.

```bash docker
docker-compose up
```

## 4.a Forward data to your local instance with script tag

Add `data-host`, add `data-port`, add `data-secure` and set up at true if is https, false if is http,

```javascript
<script defer data-project="project_id_here" data-host="your-host-name" data-port="your-port" data-secure="true/false"
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js">
</script>
```


## 4.b Forward data to your local instance using npm

Add `data-host`, add `data-port`, add `data-secure` and set up at true if is https, false if is http,

```javascript
Lit.init('proect_id', {
  server: {
    host: "your-host-name",
    port: 123,
    secure: true
  }
})
```
## 5. Now is your turn.

Now you are up to go. You can use your own instance of Litlyx. Track analytics, easy way.
